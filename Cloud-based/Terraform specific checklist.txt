 State Management
•	Store terraform.tfstate remotely (e.g., S3 with encryption + DynamoDB locking).
•	Enable state encryption at rest and in transit.
•	Restrict access to state files via IAM policies.
•	Never commit state files or .terraform directories to Git.

 Security Tools
•	Use TFSec and Checkov to scan .tf files.
•	Enable Sentinel policies (for Terraform Enterprise) for policy-as-code enforcement.
•	Validate all terraform plan and apply operations in CI/CD before production.

 Module Hygiene
•	Use source with version-pinned modules.
•	Avoid dynamic blocks with unvalidated input.
•	Avoid reusing modules without understanding what resources they deploy.
