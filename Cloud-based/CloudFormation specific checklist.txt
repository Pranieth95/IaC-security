Stack & Template Management
•	Validate templates with cfn-lint or CloudFormation Designer.
•	Use Change Sets to preview stack changes before applying.
•	Set up rollback triggers for critical stacks.

Security Scanning
•	Use CFN-Nag to scan templates for insecure configurations.
•	Check for AWS::IAM::Policy and AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup misconfigurations.
•	Validate use of !Ref, !GetAtt, and !Sub to ensure correct referencing and logic.

Stack Security
•	Use StackSets with delegated permissions carefully.
•	Set TerminationProtection for critical stacks.
•	Tag resources with security metadata (e.g., owner, environment, sensitivity).
